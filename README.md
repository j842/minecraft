# drunner/minecraft

A simple Minecraft server dService for dRunner 1.0.

Pauses server on backup/restore. All data and configuration in backup. Can run multiple servers on
a host just by using different ports. :-)

This is a version 2 dService, so requires the C++ version of dRunner.

See also drunner/minecraftviewer for providing the minecraft map via a webpage.

## Use

```
drunner install minecraft
minecraft configure port=25565
minecraft start
```

## Modifying server settings

```
docker run -ti -v drunner-minecraft-minecraftdata:/mc drunner/drunner_utils /bin/bash
nano -w /mc/server.properties
exit
minecraft stop
minecraft start
```
